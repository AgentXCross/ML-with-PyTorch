**PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning â€“ Full Course** -> [Course Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=V_xro1bcAuA&t=2629s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)<br>
A hands-on code intensive course done in Jupyter Notebooks. Teaches:
- **Tensor Operations and Manipulation**
  - Creating, indexing, slicing on tensors
  - Shape, dtype, device(GPU/CPU)
  - Basic math, matrix multiplication, reshaping (squeeze, unsqueeze, transpose)
- **PyTorch Model Workflow**
  - Data -> Model -> Loss Function -> Optimizer -> Training Loop (For every epoch: Forward Pass, Loss Calculation, Zero Grad Optimizer, Backpropagation, Gradient Descent)
  - Saving and loading models
- **Neural Network building and evaluation for Regression, Binary Classification, and Multiclass Classification**
  - Regression with linear layers `nn.Linear`
  - `nn.Sequential` and `nn.Module`
  - Non-Linear Activation Layers `nn.ReLU`
  - Binary Classification with `torch.sigmoid` and `nn.BinaryCrossEntropy`
  - Multiclass Classification with `torch.softmax` and `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`
- **CNN-based Computer Vision Image Classification**
